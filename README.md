# Predicting HDB Resale Prices

## Background

A project introduced by General Assembly, Teams of 3 had to build a linear regression model to predict HDB resale prices accurately within a week. A presentation (see pdf) to communicate our findings was done at the end of the week. Graphs within the presentation were plotted using matplotlib or seaborn library.

Currently, the code notebook is still a work in progress.
